# Implementation Report: CP-4 through CP-9

## Summary
Successfully implemented all requested features from prompts CP-4 through CP-9, including Strategy Lab enhancements, E2E testing, alpha-based capital allocation, edge calibration, arbitrage scoring, and advanced trading strategies.

## Completed Features

### CP-4: Strategy Lab with PASS/FAIL Rules ✓
**Location**: `src/api/strategies.py`, `config/strategy_lab.yaml`
- Implemented automated PASS/FAIL evaluation for strategies
- Added configurable rules per strategy (win_rate, pnl_pct, maker_fill_rate, etc.)
- API endpoints for running tests and checking status
- Integration with job runner for async execution

### CP-5: E2E Test for Dev Console ✓
**Location**: `tests/e2e/dev_console.spec.ts`
- Playwright-based E2E tests for dev console
- Tests QA proof execution and log streaming
- Tests strategy execution from UI
- Validates job state transitions (PENDING → RUNNING → DONE/FAIL)

### CP-6: Allocator + Alpha Scoreboard ✓
**Location**: `src/ai/allocator.py`
- Alpha scoring system using multiple metrics:
  - Sharpe ratio (30% weight)
  - Win rate (25% weight)
  - Fill quality (20% weight)
  - Latency penalty (-15% weight)
  - Drawdown penalty (-10% weight)
- Softmax-based capital allocation
- Constraints enforcement (min/max per strategy)
- Automatic weight calculation saved to `logs/allocator_weights.json`

### CP-7: Net Edge Calibration ✓
**Location**: `src/execution/edge_calibrator.py`
- Analyzes realized edge from trade history
- Calculates P5, P25, P50, P95 percentiles of realized edge
- Auto-calibrates min_edge_bps using P95 + safety margin
- Updates `config/execution.yaml` automatically
- Generates calibration report in `logs/edge_calibration_report.json`

### CP-8: TR Arbitrage Opportunity Scorer ✓
**Location**: `src/trading/arb_scorer.py`
- Scores arbitrage opportunities 0-1 using weighted features:
  - Net spread (2.0 weight)
  - Depth balance (0.8 weight)
  - Volatility (-0.5 weight)
  - Latency (-1.0 weight)
  - Recent fail rate (-1.5 weight)
- Dynamic position sizing based on score:
  - < 0.3: No trade
  - 0.3-0.5: Minimum size
  - 0.5-0.7: 20-60% scaling
  - 0.7-1.0: 60-100% scaling
- Tracks recent trade success/failure for fail rate calculation

### CP-9: Strategy Pack ✓
**Location**: `src/strategies/liquidation_hunter.py`, `src/strategies/funding_farmer.py`

#### Liquidation Hunter
- Hunts liquidation cascades in BTC/ETH/BNB/SOL
- WebSocket connection to Binance liquidation stream
- Cascade detection and scoring algorithm
- Smart entry timing (waits 3-7 seconds after cascade)
- Position management with TP (1.5%) and SL (0.5%)
- Max hold time of 5 minutes
- Paper test runner: `tools/run_liquidation_hunter.py`

#### Funding Rate Farmer
- Delta-neutral positions to harvest funding rates
- Scans for negative funding rates across perpetuals
- Automatic rebalancing to maintain delta neutrality
- Funding collection every 8 hours
- Risk assessment (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH)
- Compound earnings option
- Paper test runner: `tools/run_funding_farmer.py`

## Integration Points

### Strategy Lab Integration
Both new strategies integrated with Strategy Lab:
```yaml
liquidation_hunter:
  enabled: true
  pass_rules:
    pnl_pct: 0.0  # > 0%
    win_rate: 52  # >= 52%
    
funding_farmer:
  enabled: true
  pass_rules:
    pnl_usdt: 0.0  # > 0 USDT
    exposure_ratio: 0.30  # <= 30%
```

### API Endpoints
- `/api/strategies/run` - Run any strategy test
- `/api/strategies/status` - Get all strategies status

## Testing

### Run Strategy Lab Tests
```bash
# Test liquidation hunter
python tools/run_liquidation_hunter.py --mins 15

# Test funding farmer  
python tools/run_funding_farmer.py --mins 15

# Run via API
curl -X POST http://localhost:8002/api/strategies/run \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "liquidation_hunter", "mins": 15}'
```

### Run E2E Tests
```bash
npx playwright test tests/e2e/dev_console.spec.ts
```

### Run Calibration
```bash

## Key Features

### Smart Scoring Systems
- **Arbitrage Scorer**: Multi-factor scoring with sigmoid activation
- **Alpha Allocator**: Sharpe-based scoring with softmax allocation
- **Opportunity Scorer**: Risk-adjusted scoring for funding opportunities

### Risk Management
- Dynamic position sizing based on confidence scores
- Delta-neutral positions for funding farming
- Max hold times and exposure limits
- Fail rate tracking and blacklisting

### Paper Trading Integration
- Realistic fill simulation
- Simulated liquidation cascades
- Mock funding rate data
- Performance metrics tracking

## Success Metrics
All strategies include comprehensive metrics:
- P&L tracking (percentage and absolute)
- Win rate calculation
- APY/Sharpe ratio calculation
- Drawdown monitoring
- Exposure ratio tracking

## Next Steps
1. Enable strategies in production after thorough paper testing
2. Tune scoring weights based on realized performance
3. Add more sophisticated prediction models
4. Implement cross-strategy risk limits
5. Add real-time monitoring dashboard
